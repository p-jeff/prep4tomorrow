### Regular Toothbrush

Toothbrushes, while now beeing produced in low labour cost countries, will probably be easily produced locally. Places without acces to large amounts of crude oil for plastics will probably switch to a wooden construction. But since this will make toothbrushes more expensive, it is highly likely that one will try to extend the life of a toothbrush as long as possible.
