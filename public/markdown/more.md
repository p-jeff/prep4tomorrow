### GRWM: Preparing for Tomorrow

### Initial Goal
Throughout history, humans have always speculated about the future. Initially, our concerns revolved around basic survival, such as ensuring our next meal. As civilization progressed, we began to plan ahead, storing grain for harsher months. Prophets emerged, catering to the idea of an afterlife, where the future held eternal happiness in the Garden of Eden. These beliefs assumed little to no change within a lifetime or between lifetimes. In the past, if a 17th-century king sought advice, he would consult a historian who would likely repeat what worked for previous kings. However, life has accelerated rapidly. The 20th century brought technological advancements, science fiction entered the mainstream, and the field of statistics became more refined. Futurology gained importance, and politicians now consult statisticians for accurate predictions when making decisions. This development has allowed us to forecast weather, predict climate change, prepare for population growth, and allocate resources efficiently. By following trends, we can make more accurate predictions. However, what happens in areas we cannot predict? The Blockbuster-Netflix case is a famous example where Blockbuster's CEO laughed at the idea of video on demand outpacing physical media. If Blockbuster had embraced digital technology instead of Netflix, the story might have been different. The Blockbuster CEO believed in the past, assuming what worked before would work forever. In contrast, the founder of Netflix embraced new technologies as they emerged, perhaps out of necessity for his smaller company. Whether he had foresight or was simply lucky is debatable, but the story demonstrated the necessity of futurology and accurate speculation for 21st-century businesses. While futurology is still debated, it has entered the mainstream under the guise of statistics and with philosophical confidence. However, it struggles to gain acceptance as a true science due to the lack of scientific debate. Futurology is often presented in a marketing context, leaving little room for discussion. Questioning the narrative can lead to being labeled an enemy of progress. Futurology claims scientific accuracy and has permeated the public consciousness through literature and talks. However, true science relies on debate and conflict, with ideas surviving critical examination by multiple scientists. To gain a general idea of the future, a debate among multiple futurologists should yield a consensus. As long as isolated futures exist, caution is necessary when evaluating their objectives. Presently, futurology often serves as a marketing ploy.

### Method
I started out reading a lot of non-fiction literature on the future of humanity, to get a general understanding of the possible directions there are. Whenever i found a description of an object, or had an idea based on a theory proclaimed in the literature, i set out to quickly build a prototype. With this process i built around ten objects, but soon identified a large issue. Since each where poster children for their respective futures, none fulfilled the same purpose in day to day life, and were not comperable. While looking for an overarching situation i realised that some futures ideal objects already exist. I used this to my advantage since it made it easier to flesh out the context of a given future, especially with products that are marketed as part of or a path to a certain future ideal. For example when buying an aluminium free, net-zero deodorant stick in cardboard packaging, you also buy into the belief of a eco-capitalist or sustainable future. You buy, believing that your purchase is bringing us closer to that goal.
Some objects however do not exist yet, so we have to extrapolate current ideals to fill the gaps left open in a given future. This was the main part of my work. What Ideals are proclaimed by the patrons of a given narrative?, What technologies already exists or are plausible?, How could these be implemented in a consumer product? and how would this implementation look like and function?.
This speculative process was the groundwork of my exploration. And while creative in nature, it still helps to provide valuable insights. Especially once you start prototyping the speculative objects. Once in hand, a prototype might answer questions you did not even know where important beforehand. Refining the prototype inevitabely leads to refing the narrative you are trying to tell.
Interacting with the prototype leads to more discoveries, how does my behaviour change? How do i feel about it? Most important however is the very last step, showing the objects to other people, how do they react? What do they think? 
The resulting discussions about personal beliefs were almost always more hands-on and way more in depth than pure ideological discussions.

### The Presented Futures

### Selfmade Future
In a situation where international supply chains break down, what everyday objects would have to change? This Future imagines scarcity, and a turn away from our current life of abundance.
Be it climate change, pandemics or wars, if international shipping is reduced to a minimum, we have to get creative. What can be used as substitutes? What can be produced locally? What can be home grown? 

### Ecocapitalism
How can we merge our current system with climate disaster avoidance?
Ecocapitalism claims to have the answers. Replacing plastics with sustainable materials like wood or paper and making things recyclabe or compostable. This is seen as an easy fix to the flaws of today, without having to give up much of our comfort and luxury. Some of these products already exist today, usually with a hefty marketing budged. But is this really a solution or just treating the symptoms?

### Start-Up Future
Can we not just invent ourselves out of our problems? According to the proponents of this future, we need not worry. Technological advancements will trickle down into our everyday lives and medical equipment will become so small, easy to operate and cheap that we can all get access to them. You just have to believe in progress.

### Space Future
Why even worry about planet earth if we can just find a new place to live?
Wo does not want to explore the final frontier? But is life among the stars really that great? What do we have to give up once were out there?
