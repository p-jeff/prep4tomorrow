### Butter-Knife Razor

While razor blades are usually produced quite close to where they are sold, the steel that is needed for them is not. Steel production usually relies on a mix of local and international ore, as well as scrap steel. Sourcing all of it from one source might produce lower quality steel. 
Adding to this, when a global event leads to steel scarcity, energy and labour intensive single use objects are probanly the first to be rationed.

To still be able to shave, one has to find a different steel blade, able to be sharpened to a high degree. A regular butterknife perfectly serves this purpose. Usually Stainless Steel, and without a pointy edge, and most importantly, abundant. Getting one razor sharp might be a little labour intensive, but the shape perfectly lends it to be used as a straight razor.
