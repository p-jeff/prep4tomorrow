### Eco Brush

The Bamboo Toothbrush is one of the quintesesential "sustainable" products. Saving the plastic and replacing it with wood, leaving oil in the ground and making a more or less compostable product. 
With an electric toothbrush, you only have to replace the head, instead of the entire toothbrush, saving some materials. But you will need to buy those heads once in a while.
