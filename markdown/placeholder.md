### GRWM: Preparing for Tomorrow

Narratives of certain futures have become a major marketing tool. Especially western capitalist future visions present themselves
in a desirable way, while only representing a slim part of society. 

Negative visions are only presented as transitionary periods, since no decrease in living standard is acceptable. A given vision presents itself as the sole truth, relying on a belief in theoretical technological advancements to fill narrative gaps.

There is no need for criticism since as soon a certain point of desire is reached, the capitalistic nature will solve itself and inequalities will become nonexistent, allowing humanity to continue at this point of desire in perpetuity.

The project imagines how the mundane parts of these futures could look like, through objects of our day to day life, in this case objects for personal hygiene.
