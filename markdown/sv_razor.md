### Laser-Shave

Laser Hair-Removal as a treatment has been available for some time now. But it usually involves going to a specialist, who uses quite the large machine. Would it not be lovely to have a laser hair remover in the size of a regular razor? You would only need to shave maybe once or twice a month, maybe even less.
