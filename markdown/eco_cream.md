### Deodorant Cream

Deodorant comes either in a hard to recycle stick, or even worse, in aerosol form with a nasty propellant. Why not just offer it in a small metal tin as a cream? You can reuse the tin afterwards, or maybe even send it back to the manufacturer. This way you can use exactly the amount you need, and save yourself those armpit-freezing sprays.
